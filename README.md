Usernames that work: user1, user2, user3

Attatched in this repository are photos/files to use and upload with the program to make grading easier.

For our creative portion, we had two components. First, we gave the user the ability to chsoe a profile photo for themselves and then showcase that photo at the top of the page. They also have the option to change it (and delete their old one) at the bottom of the page. Also, we made little icon images to correspond to what files are in the user's directory, like for a .txt file and an .img file all have their own icons.
